### Hardware Overview
#### Pinout
<img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1217/2104/files/relaypinout.jpg?v=1688467593">

- (1) 4 Relay
- (2) Relay ON/OFF status LED

#### Interfacing Details
RL_1, RL_2, RL_3 & RL_4 relay pins are directly connected with Arduino UNO Digital pin number 4-7 when mounted.
Similarly when mounted on Ardi32 it will used IO 41, 2, 9 and 14 pins

- COM - Common pin
- NC - Normally Closed, will be connected with COM when RELAY is OFF i.e. when not triggered
- NO - Normally Open, will be connected with COM when RELAY switched ON i.e when triggered

### Warning: Take precautions when working with HIGH VOLTAGE AC. Improper handling could result in fatality. As a result, it is advised to use under the supervision of experts.
